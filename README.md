# Flag Shooting Game

CinsFlags is a game based on TCP/IP communication technology.  Itâ€™s built on Visual Studio 2019 using C# programming language. In order to implement TCP/IP communication there are also some other technologies used like asynchronous sockets and helper classes. Helper classes are a set of classes provided by Microsoft to simplify network programming, where it might be difficult and confusing to use Socket classes. Besides with the help of asynchronous socket programming, the application flow is not blocked while waiting for network operation to be performed. This paper aims to use these technologies successfully in a game and provide a fully working application. The purpose of the game is, to find the five flags and associated areas captured by the opponent on a map. Random shoots are done with mouse clicks on the map in order to find these points. The players are informed if the shot point is in an area or a flag.
